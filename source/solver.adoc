== Solver

The solver is the part of VirtualBow that actually performs the required calculations.
It is invoked automatically by the model editor when a simulation is started, but can also be used on its own for advanced use cases.

=== Command Line Interface

The executables for the three components of VirtualBow are named

----
virtualbow-gui        // Model editor
virtualbow-slv        // Solver
virtualbow-post       // Result viewer
----

The solver executable takes a `.bow` model file as its input, performs the simulation and saves the results as a `.res` file that can be opened by the result viewer.
The type of simulation (static or dynamic) as well as other options are set by the command line arguments.
The detailed usage as shown by the `--help` option is:

----
Usage: virtualbow-slv [options] input output

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Displays this help.
  -v, --version   Displays version information.
  -s, --static    Run a static simulation.
  -d, --dynamic   Run a dynamic simulation.
  -p, --progress  Print simulation progress.

Arguments:
  input           Model file (.bow)
  output          Result file (.res)
----

NOTE: To use the command line interfaces on Windows you have to either specify the complete path to the respective executable or add the installation directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
There is an option to do this automatically during installation of VirtualBow.

NOTE: On MacOS, the VirtualBow executables are hidden inside the application bundle.
They can be accessed by their full path though, or their location can be temporarily added to the `PATH` environment variable with the command `export PATH = $PATH:/Applications/VirtualBow.app/Contents/MacOS`.
Put this line into your `.bash_profile` if you want it to be permanently added.

=== File Formats

The input files of the solver are `.bow` model files as created by the model editor.
The model files use the text based https://www.json.org/[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)] format.
JSON is a very common exchange format for hierarchical data in the form of objects, arrays, strings, numbers and more.
Since the format is text based, it is easy to inspect and modify with a text editor.

The output files of the solver are `.res` result files that can be opened with the result viewer.
The result files use the binary https://msgpack.org/[MessagePack] format.
MessagePack is very similar to JSON (see [input files](input_files.md)) in the kind of data it can represent, but more space efficient due to being a binary format.
Unlike the input files, the output files cannot be inspected with a text editor.

For use cases like scripting (see <<#_scripting>>) that require reading and writing `.bow` or `.res` files , the exact contents are specified in <<#_file_specifications>>.

=== Scripting

The main use of the solver as a standalone application is the ability to write programs that automatically launch simulations and analyze the results.
This is especially useful when a large number of simulations needs to be done, for example when performing design optimizations or exploring the influence of certain model parameters on the simulation results.

Scripts that interoperate with VirtualBow have to be able to call the solver via the command line interface (see <<#_command_line_interface>>) as well as read and write the model and result files that constitute the input and output of the solver.
For a detailed description of those files, see <<#_file_formats>> and the specifications in <<#_file_specifications>>.

As a consequence of the model and result file formats, any programming language that supports JSON and MessagePack can be used.
Since both are fairl common formats, most languages either have built-in support or external libraries available.
Basic examples for Python, Malab and Julia can be found in <<#_example_scripts>>.
